# IPE Data Analysis
This is a project I took on during my time as a peer advisor at the IPE (international programs in engineering) office as a peer advisor at UMich. With this data analysis project, I took unsanitized excel sheets from study abroad program pre-arrival surveys to determine the major motivating factors for students to study abroad. This informed marketing approaches for the IPE office.

Resultant plots found in the Plots folder. Unsanitized data found in Majors, PreArrival, SU23/24Arrival, WN23/24Arrival. The analysis, completed using Python Pandas in a Jupyter notebook, is in main_analysis.ipynb.
